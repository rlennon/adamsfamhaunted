Maven downloads the automates the downloading of dependencies, complies, tests and packages the code
into an app. Maven also can install and deploy.  Maven is centered around building Java applications and packages,
these application files and package files are WAR, JAR and EAR files and you can deploy them to a variety of different targets
Other project build tools courses more on the how of the project rather than the what you need done. Maven is centrally controlled by the pom.xml.
In the POM file you can define the goals such as clean, compile, test, package, install and deploy. These goals are invoked sequqnciley.
 
Maven reduces the complexity of the build process of the project, Maven setups can be simply reusable most of the time. Maven's goal is to provide the developer with a maintainable, ease to comprehend and reusable model. Maven also allows plugins and tools that can be used in different projects. The structure of the project is defined in an xml called pom.xml which is a Project Object Model (POM).
