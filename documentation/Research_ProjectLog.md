Research on Project logs

* project log tracks project risks, surprises and issues

* this helps the project be more open to change 

* watches risk to prevent further complication

* kept public so all team members can see it

* manages unavoidable surprises, keeps them to a minimum 

* examples of components tracked on a project log are as follows:
	 change requests, assumptions, action items, issues, and risks

* the log records what these items are, their origin, and what’s needed to complete them

* by making the log public and allowing all team members to access it and update it
 	 allows for better communication and collaboration 

* components covered are interchangeable based on the project so 
	 it does not have to be change requests and assumptions etc. as item titles

* all members should interact with the log 

* these logs are generally colour coded by an items risk level to the project

* these logs can be co-ordinated by project action - sprint dates - priority - status of completion - project notes
