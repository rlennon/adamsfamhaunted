open source security risks and rewards:



Pro: reliable
open source is particularly reliable as it is constantly being monitered by 
many people all around the globe, making it better and fixing bugs. The large
number of people at open sources disposal can be more effective than the small
team a private company will have. 

con support:
there is generally no support team that can help along the average user. 
open source softwares are generally not as user friendly. they are usually
made for and by experts. there is little UX though put in to the design. 
there is less user manuals avaiable. 


pro: infinate(for the most par)
open source software can go on infinately if there is enough intrest from the users
and developers to keep it going. private companies are not infinate in most cases
and if the software(product) they are pushing becomes less popular or makes them 
less money, they are likely to stop the project, defund it, and disband developers
working on the project. open source software can be disconinued but generally has
less reasons to and unanimous agreement to. 


pro cyber security:
An open source software is constantly changing and is constantly monitored by
developers/users all over the world. when there is a bug or issue with the 
software, this can be evaluated and fixed more regularly as there is a vast 
amount of people at all hours of the day at the softwares disposal to fix
these issues. If a cyber attack was launched on an open source software 
there could be a more swift intervention by developers as they are constantly 
monitoring it and able to defend it.

con cyber security:
the con with open source software for cyber security is that because it is 
avaiable to be viewed and edited by anyone, this means it is much more open
to attack and malicious intent. this makes it a much more open target for 
malicious code.

pro: flexible
open source in its nature is open to change. if you require it to work for
your project in a particular way you can edit it to do this. this is not
the case for private softwares as the code and information is likely
blackboxed and not publically avaiable. 

con: user friendlieness 
as explained before most open source softwares are hard to navigate as they
are designed for experts by experts with no position designated for UX design. 


conclusion:
based on the information put forward i beleive that open source and private softwares
both have psoitives and negatives to their security. Each one should be decided based 
on project requirements. I do however beleive from this ressearch that open source 
software is likely more secure in most cases. I beleive this because it will likely 7
be supported for a longer time than private software. If a bug or attack occurs 
it will be delt with more swiftly and timely. Developer error will be more widely 
scrutinized and fixed. I beleive these factors make open source software a more secure
environment in most use case scinarious of software. An area it may not be useful 
is a small scale private software with a small network, such as a database of hotel staff
employment details. this information is important and does not need to be accessed outside
of said hotel, therefore it would be best designed by a private company to develop and 
do upkeep as it is unlikely a wide amount of people would chose to do work of this system for
free and would have little access to it.
